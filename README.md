This is my repository for the AIM-5002 Computational Statistics and Probability course, offered by the Katz School of Science and Health. Throughout this course, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of statistical analysis and probability theory, and to gain hands-on experience in applying these techniques to a wide range of real-world problems.  Through a combination of lectures, assignments, and projects, I have developed a strong foundation in statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.  I hope that my work serves as a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in exploring the fascinating world of computational statistics and probability.
